## Static Source Code Analysis Report

For our project we decided to use SonarLint which is integratable with VS Code. We addressed most of the issues/warnings that SonarLint was telling us to fix. The only exceptions was those that had to do with importing the .css files. If we look at the screenshot below, we can see that SonarLint is giving us warnings that these imports are not being used.

If we decided to address these issues, the correct styling of the homepage will not be displayed. If we take a look at the first screenshot, this shows what happens when addressing the issues, while the second screenshot shows when the warnings are left unchanged.
