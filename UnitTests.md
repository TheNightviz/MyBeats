## Code Coverage Report

For our code coverage we were able to successfully run over 50 unit tests and cover over 70% of our code. We went ahead and wrote unit tests for each of the pages in our project to make sure the functionality of that particular page is working flawlessly as well as making sure that the pages had the correct implementation of various aesthetic features.

Our folder containing our tests for each page can be found [here](https://github.com/TheNightviz/MyBeats/tree/master/my-beats/src/cypress/support/integration)
